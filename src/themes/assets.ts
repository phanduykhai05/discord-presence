 * NOTHING (silently, no error) for an unknown key. Contributors can't upload new
 * assets to the shared app, so every built-in theme must stay within the known
 * set below. The `validateThemeAssets` guard backs a test that makes shipping an
 * unknown key impossible.
 *
 * Keys may contain the `{state}` placeholder (e.g. `status-{state}`), which the
 * render engine expands to `status-<activity-state>`. We validate those against
 * the full `status-<state>` family rather than the literal placeholder string.
